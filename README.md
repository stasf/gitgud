# The Simpsons Tapped Out

TSTO App is a SASS-driven responsive application that uses HTML data from AEM which is then styled by CSS.

## About the app
For this application I used a GULP watch service that compiles my SASS code every time I saved it. The same service would then add all the cross-browser compatibility prefixes, minified the code and created a production-ready .css file.

For the general layout I used the css flexbox layout. There are several key breakpoints that transform the look of the page based on the width of the browser (Desktop | Tablet | Phone). You can see the layout transform by shrinking the window size horizontally.
